    <p>
Below you will find the assignment for this module, or lecture.
You answer the assignment by filling in the form.
The form includes 7 steps that will guide your discussions. Each step includes a short description of what
you should do. It also includes a suggested timeframe for each step. You fill in the form by way of keywords
or full paragraphs. Use sources, when necessary, there is a section at the end for references. Preferably use
the style of APA7th. Each step is given an approximate word count, meant as a guideline, rather than
absolute criteria.
Before you start solving the assignment, you need to distribute roles in the group:
- There needs to be a group leader, for this assignment, who is responsible for reading out the
assignment and following the 7 steps.
- A note-taker, which does the writing, saves the document and hands it in, in Canvas, when you
have finished the assignment.
- A timekeeper, which assures that you stay within the allocated time frame.
- All other members of the group must be stated under “other members” by their full name.
- Only members of the group that have their name on this assignment, and hence have actually
participated in the discussion, can get a pass and include the assignment as 1 of 5 obligatory
assignments qualifying for the exam.
